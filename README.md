OBD ii GPS tracker is the most convenient vehicle GPS tracking device. This tracker plugs into a vehicle’s OBD II port for easy installation. The OBD ii tracker installs within seconds and runs itself. OBD tracker can be used in any car or van manufactured after 2000.

Why we need OBD?

SPEED ALERT BETA
 “The device can be set to alert you when the vehicle exceeds the posted speed limit of whatever road it is currently travelling on.

SPEED THRESHOLD
 The device can be set to alert you whenever the vehicle exceeds a certain speed.

HARSH BRAKING
 The device tracks the rate of deceleration of the vehicle, a major indicator of aggressive driving, and alerts you when the vehicle exceeds a safe threshold.

RAPID ACCELERATION
Another major indicator of aggressive driving, the device also tracks the rate of acceleration of the vehicle and alerts you when the vehicle exceeds a safe threshold.”

 
 
 
OBD-II Background
The OBD-II specification is controlled by the Society of Automobile Engineers and defines the method for requesting diagnostic data and provides a list of standard parameters from the engine control unit. The specification was first released in 1979. Today, depending upon the vehicle, the tracker can retrieve values that include: throttle, engine RPM, fuel available. In some vehicles, the device can even retrieve engine diagnostic codes.

Where is my OBD-II Port?
The OBD-II diagnostic port, also known as a Data Link Connector (DLC), is generally located on the driver’s side of the car or truck under the dash. The location will vary between different manufacturers, models, and production years of a car or truck model.
